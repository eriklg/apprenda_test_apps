# Test Application for the Apprenda Platform


This repository contains three different applications to help test application deployments on the Apprenda Platform. Each application exposes an endpoint (api/tests) that returns "Success" if you can reach the application. 

The source code and archives are located in this repository under each technology, the docker container for the kubernetes version can be found on my docker hub account.
